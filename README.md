📄 Project Overview
This Java-based File Handling Utility is a simple command-line tool that performs essential file operations such as writing to a file, reading file contents, and modifying existing content. It is designed with simplicity in mind, making it ideal for beginners and intermediate Java programmers learning about file I/O.

✅ Features Implemented
Write to File: Allows users to enter custom text which will be saved to a file (sample.txt). Existing content is overwritten.

Read File: Displays the contents of the file line by line to the console.

Modify File: Enables users to replace a specific word in the file with another word throughout the entire content.

🧪 Example Operations
Input: "asit is learning java."

Modify: Replace "asit" with "liku"

Output: "liku is learning java."

These features demonstrate the use of Java classes like FileWriter, BufferedReader, Scanner, and string manipulation techniques.

🔧 Possible Enhancements
While the current implementation handles basic operations, future improvements could include:

Append Mode: Add data without overwriting existing content.

Dynamic File Naming: Let users specify the file name.

File Deletion: Add the ability to delete unwanted files.

Directory Listing: Show files within a folder.

GUI Support: Build a Swing-based user interface.

🏁 Conclusion
The Java File Handling Utility project helped reinforce core file I/O concepts such as reading, writing, and modifying files. It provides a practical and user-friendly console interface that makes learning Java file operations engaging and clear. This project lays a solid foundation for more advanced file management utilities.
